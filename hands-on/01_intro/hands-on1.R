# 4. Print the content of b to the console

# 5. Substract object a from object b

# 6. Save the result of b - a in b

# 7. Use rnorm() to create 10 random draws from a standard normal
# Remember that you can use the 'tab' key to get tooltips for the function

# 8. Call up the help file for the function rnorm(). What happens if you run
# rnorm(10)?

# 1 Set your working directory to the workshop folder which you downloaded.

# 2 Open the file BundestagForecastReplicationData.csv and assign its content to
# an object.

# 3 How many observations are in the dataset?

# 4 How many variables does the dataset contain?

# 5 Create a variable of type logical which is TRUE for each election after 1990
# and FALSE for all others. Simply checke whether year is greater or equal to
# 1990 and write the result of that comparison in a new variable.

# 6 Calculate the mean of the variable outgovshare.

# 7 Remove the logical variable indicating the post-1990 elections.

# 8 Z-Tranform the variable outgovshare. The function sd() calculates the
# standard deviation of a variable which you need for z-transformation.
# Remember: z = (x - mean(x))/sd(x)

# 9 Save the data in a separate file.

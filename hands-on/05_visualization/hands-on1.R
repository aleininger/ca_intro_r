# 1. Load ggplot2.

# 2. Read the file btw2013.csv and assign it to an object. It's in the data folder.

# 3. Create a scatterplot of turnout against unemployment.

# 4. Label the axes.

# 5. Highlight east and west germany by changing the color or shape of the dots.
# Check out scale_color_discrete() or scale_shape_discrete() for modifying the legend.

# 6. Include two black linear fit lines (with out confidence intervals), one for
# east, one for west. Check the help for geom_smooth to find out how to surpress
# confidence intervals.

# 7. Instead of separating dots and lines by east vs. west, facet the plot by
# federal state.

# 8. You notice a spelling mistake: "Schleswig-Holsten". The correct spelling is
# "Schleswig-Holstein". Correct this mistake.

# "Introduction to R" Workshop

30 November 2019, CorrelAid Meetup at CityLab Berlin

## Course Contents and Learning Objectives

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics that has gained widespread acceptance in the worldwide research community. This is due to several reasons: It is an open source solution and a comprehensive statistical software that has state-of-the-art graphic capabilities and offers enormous flexibility. The objective of the workshop will be to teach the basic knowledge needed to use R independently, thus helping you as participant initiate your own process of learning the specific tools needed for your research.

The workshop is taught by [Yannik Buhl](https://yannikbuhl.netlify.com/) and [Arndt Leininger](https://aleininger.eu/); it mixes structured lectures with practical exercises and is based on materials from [Arndt Leininger's](https://aleininger.eu/) 1 1/2 days [
